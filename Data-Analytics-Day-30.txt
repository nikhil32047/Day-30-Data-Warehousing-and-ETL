Topics & Explanations 

1. Introduction to Data Warehousing

A data warehouse is a central repository where data from multiple sources is stored for reporting and analysis.

Example: A retail company gathers sales data from stores, online platforms, and mobile apps, then stores it in a warehouse for unified reporting.


2. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process

Extract: Collect data from various sources (databases, APIs, flat files).

Transform: Clean, format, and standardize the data.

Load: Insert the transformed data into the warehouse.

Example: A company extracts raw customer data → removes duplicates → loads it into a warehouse for insights.


3. Star Schema & Snowflake Schema

Star Schema: Central fact table (sales, revenue, etc.) linked to dimension tables (customers, products). Easy for queries.

Snowflake Schema: Similar, but dimensions are normalized into multiple related tables. Saves storage but complex for queries.


4. OLAP vs OLTP

OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): Handles day-to-day transactions (banking systems, e-commerce checkout).

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): Optimized for queries and analysis (trend reports, dashboards).


5. Case Study – Building a Simple Data Warehouse

Example:

Sources: Online sales data, CRM customer data.

ETL: Clean + integrate data.

Schema: Star schema with Sales Fact Table + Customer/Products Dimensions.
